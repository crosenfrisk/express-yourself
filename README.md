## Installation

The user will visit the deployed site, and after creating an account can participate in Express Yourself as a member of the EY community, writing and responding to posts. If you are a developer that would like to use the project for your own creation, please download/clone code directly from GitHub or fork the repository.

## Usage

Visit site to login and create content!

If you intend to build a similar site or replicate using my source code, be sure to install and use the following npm:

* express-handlebars npm package to use Handlebars.js for Views
* MySQL2 and 
* Sequelize npm to connect to db for models
and 
* Express.js API for controllers

Additionally need 
* dotenv npm for .env variables
* bcrypt npm to hash passwords
* express-session and 
* connect-session-sequelize npm for authentication
